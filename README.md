## Description
The given text describes the functionality of a book search engine with user account capabilities. When the search engine is loaded, users are presented with a menu that includes options to search for books and login/signup. If users click on "Search for Books," they are provided with an input field and a submit button to search for books.

If users are not logged in and enter a search term, the search engine displays several search results, each showing a book's title, author, description, image, and a link to the book on the Google Books site.

Clicking on the "Login/Signup" option opens a modal with a toggle between login and signup. If users choose signup, they need to provide a username, email address, and password before clicking the signup button. On successful signup, their user account is created, and they are logged into the site. If they choose login, they need to enter their email address and password to log in.

Once logged in, the menu options change to "Search for Books," an option to view saved books, and "Logout." Users can search for books and save the search results to their account. Each saved book displays its title, author, description, image, and a link to the Google Books site. Users can also remove saved books from their account.

Clicking the "Logout" button logs users out of the site and presents them with the initial menu, offering the options to search for books and login/signup.

In summary, the book search engine allows users to search for books and provides the option to create a user account. When logged in, users can save and remove books from their account, view their saved books, and logout from the site. The interface is designed to make book searching and account management easy and convenient for users.
